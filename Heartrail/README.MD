# Heart Trail beginner 


This code creates a fun visual effect on a webpage where hearts appear and trail the mouse cursor as it moves around the screen. Each time the mouse moves, a heart of random size is generated at the cursor's position and follows it. The hearts gradually fade away after a second, leaving a trail of love in their wake.
