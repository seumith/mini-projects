# Welcome to My Mini Projects! 🚀

This repository is a collection of small, fun projects that I've created. Each project offers a glimpse into different aspects of web development, programming concepts, or just showcases some cool visual effects.

## Projects

1. **Heart Trail**: Watch hearts follow your cursor around the screen and leave a lovely trail behind. ❤️

2. **Button Effect**: It is normal but attractive button effect which can enhance the look and feel of your website. 😊

Feel free to explore this project, learn from it! Happy coding! 😊
